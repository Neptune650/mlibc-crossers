#+title: mlibc-crossers
This repository is used to generate a collection of
=bootstrap-system-gcc=-style compilers for mlibc testing.

* Resulting image layout
=${ARCH}-linux-mlibc= toolchains are built and installed with a prefix of
=/usr/local= and configured with a sysroot in =/sysroots/${ARCH}-linux-mlibc/=,
in which mlibc and Linux headers are installed.
